      <p> In April, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code as part of its //Build conference.
      I have been using it on my MBP for most of the coding I do on the Mac.
      I found a number of things I really likeâ€¦particularly doing Node and JavaScript development.
      Best part is that it is cross platform, so I can run it on my Mac, Linux and Windows machines,
      and I have the same editing experience. With Git support built in out of the box,
           what more could I ask for? Well, here are the things I find save me the most time. </p>
    </Layout>
